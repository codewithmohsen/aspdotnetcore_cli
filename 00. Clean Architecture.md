# Clean Architecture
Over the last several years we’ve seen a whole range of ideas regarding the architecture of systems. These include [^1][^2]:

- [x] Hexagonal Architecture (a.k.a. Ports and Adapters) by Alistair Cockburn and adopted by Steve Freeman, and Nat Pryce in their wonderful book Growing Object Oriented Software
- [x] Onion Architecture by Jeffrey Palermo
- [x] Screaming Architecture from a blog of mine last year
- [x] DCI from James Coplien, and Trygve Reenskaug.
- [x] BCE by Ivar Jacobson from his book Object Oriented Software Engineering: A Use-Case Driven Approach

Though these architectures all vary somewhat in their details, they are very similar. They all have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns. They all achieve this separation by dividing the software into layers. Each has at least one layer for **business rules**, and another for **interfaces** [^1].

The diagram at the bottom is an attempt at integrating all these architectures into a single actionable idea.

## Introduction
### 0. The Dependency Rule
The concentric circles represent different areas of software. In general, the further in you go, the higher level the software becomes. The outer circles are **mechanisms**. The inner circles are **policies** [^1].

The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is The Dependency Rule. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of **something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle**. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity [^1].

By the same token, data formats used in an outer circle should not be used by an inner circle, especially if those formats are generate by a framework in an outer circle. **We don’t want anything in an outer circle to impact the inner circles** [^1].

### 1. Entities

**Entities encapsulate Enterprise wide business rules**. An entity can be an object with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions. It doesn’t matter so long as the entities could be used by many different applications in the enterprise[^1].
Entities are actually the same as Domain Entities in Domain Driven Design[^2].

### 2. Use Cases

The software in this layer contains **application specific business rules**. **It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system**. These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the **entities**, and direct those **entities** to use their enterprise wide business rules to achieve the goals of the use case [^1].

**We do not expect changes in this layer to affect the entities. We also do not expect this layer to be affected by changes to externalities such as the database, the UI, or any of the common frameworks. This layer is isolated from such concerns** [^1].

We do, however, expect that changes to the operation of the application will affect the use-cases and therefore the software in this layer. **If the details of a use-case change, then some code in this layer will certainly be affected** [^1].

### 3. Interface Adapters

The software in this layer is a **set of adapters that convert data from the format most convenient for the use cases and entities, to the format most convenient for some external agency** such as the Database or the Web. It is this layer, for example, that will wholly contain the MVC architecture of a GUI. The Presenters, Views, and Controllers all belong in here. **The models are likely just data structures that are passed from the controllers to the use cases, and then back from the use cases to the presenters and views**.

Similarly, **data is converted, in this layer, from the form most convenient for entities and use cases, into the form most convenient for whatever persistence framework is being used**. i.e. The Database. No code inward of this circle should know anything at all about the database. If the database is a SQL database, then all the SQL should be restricted to this layer, and in particular to the parts of this layer that have to do with the database.

Also **in this layer is any other adapter necessary to convert data from some external form, such as an external service, to the internal form used by the use cases and entities**.

### 4. Frameworks and Drivers
**The outermost layer is generally composed of frameworks and tools such as the Database, the Web Framework**, etc. Generally you don’t write much code in this layer other than glue code that communicates to the next circle inwards.

**This layer is where all the details go. The Web is a detail. The database is a detail. We keep these things on the outside where they can do little harm**.

## Finally
No, the circles are schematic. You may find that you need more than just these four. There’s no rule that says you must always have just these four. However, The Dependency Rule always applies. Source code dependencies always point inwards. As you move inwards the level of abstraction increases. The outermost circle is low level concrete detail. As you move inwards the software grows more abstract, and encapsulates higher level policies. The inner most circle is the most general [^1].
