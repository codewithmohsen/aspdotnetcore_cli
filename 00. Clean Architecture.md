# Clean Architecture
Over the last several years we’ve seen a whole range of ideas regarding the architecture of systems. These include [^1][^2]:

- [x] Hexagonal Architecture (a.k.a. Ports and Adapters) by Alistair Cockburn and adopted by Steve Freeman, and Nat Pryce in their wonderful book Growing Object Oriented Software
- [x] Onion Architecture by Jeffrey Palermo
- [x] Screaming Architecture from a blog of mine last year
- [x] DCI from James Coplien, and Trygve Reenskaug.
- [x] BCE by Ivar Jacobson from his book Object Oriented Software Engineering: A Use-Case Driven Approach

Though these architectures all vary somewhat in their details, they are very similar. They all have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns. They all achieve this separation by dividing the software into layers. Each has at least one layer for **business rules**, and another for **interfaces** [^1].
The diagram at the bottom is an attempt at integrating all these architectures into a single actionable idea.

## Introduction
### 1. The Dependency Rule
The concentric circles represent different areas of software. In general, the further in you go, the higher level the software becomes. The outer circles are **mechanisms**. The inner circles are **policies**.

The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is The Dependency Rule. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of **something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle**. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity.

By the same token, data formats used in an outer circle should not be used by an inner circle, especially if those formats are generate by a framework in an outer circle. **We don’t want anything in an outer circle to impact the inner circles**.

#### 1.1. Data
##### 1.1.1. Context
##### 1.1.2. Repositories
#### 1.2. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
#### 1.3. Entities
#### 1.4. Interfaces
### 2. Application Layer
#### 2.1. Extensions
#### 2.2. Sender
#### 2.3. Services
### 3. Infrastructure Layer
#### 3.1. Dependencies
### 4. Presentation Layer
#### 4.1. Controllers
#### 4.2. Models
#### 4.3. Views
