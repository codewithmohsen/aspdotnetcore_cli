# Clean Architecture
Over the last several years we’ve seen a whole range of ideas regarding the architecture of systems. These include [^1][^2]:

- [x] Hexagonal Architecture (a.k.a. Ports and Adapters) by Alistair Cockburn and adopted by Steve Freeman, and Nat Pryce in their wonderful book Growing Object Oriented Software
- [x] Onion Architecture by Jeffrey Palermo
- [x] Screaming Architecture from a blog of mine last year
- [x] DCI from James Coplien, and Trygve Reenskaug.
- [x] BCE by Ivar Jacobson from his book Object Oriented Software Engineering: A Use-Case Driven Approach

Though these architectures all vary somewhat in their details, they are very similar. They all have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns. They all achieve this separation by dividing the software into layers. Each has at least one layer for **business rules**, and another for **interfaces** [^1].

The diagram at the bottom is an attempt at integrating all these architectures into a single actionable idea.

## Introduction
### 0. The Dependency Rule
The concentric circles represent different areas of software. In general, the further in you go, the higher level the software becomes. The outer circles are **mechanisms**. The inner circles are **policies** [^1].

The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is The Dependency Rule. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of **something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle**. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity [^1].

By the same token, data formats used in an outer circle should not be used by an inner circle, especially if those formats are generate by a framework in an outer circle. **We don’t want anything in an outer circle to impact the inner circles** [^1].

### 1. Entities

**Entities encapsulate Enterprise wide business rules**. An entity can be an object with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions. It doesn’t matter so long as the entities could be used by many different applications in the enterprise[^1].
Entities are actually the same as Domain Entities in Domain Driven Design[^2].

### 2. Use Cases

The software in this layer contains **application specific business rules**. **It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system**. These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the **entities**, and direct those **entities** to use their enterprise wide business rules to achieve the goals of the use case [^1].

**We do not expect changes in this layer to affect the entities. We also do not expect this layer to be affected by changes to externalities such as the database, the UI, or any of the common frameworks. This layer is isolated from such concerns** [^1].

We do, however, expect that changes to the operation of the application will affect the use-cases and therefore the software in this layer. **If the details of a use-case change, then some code in this layer will certainly be affected** [^1].

### 3. Interface Adapters

The software in this layer is a **set of adapters that convert data from the format most convenient for the use cases and entities, to the format most convenient for some external agency** such as the Database or the Web. It is this layer, for example, that will wholly contain the MVC architecture of a GUI. The Presenters, Views, and Controllers all belong in here. **The models are likely just data structures that are passed from the controllers to the use cases, and then back from the use cases to the presenters and views**.

Similarly, **data is converted, in this layer, from the form most convenient for entities and use cases, into the form most convenient for whatever persistence framework is being used**. i.e. The Database. No code inward of this circle should know anything at all about the database. If the database is a SQL database, then all the SQL should be restricted to this layer, and in particular to the parts of this layer that have to do with the database.

Also **in this layer is any other adapter necessary to convert data from some external form, such as an external service, to the internal form used by the use cases and entities**.

### 4. Frameworks and Drivers
**The outermost layer is generally composed of frameworks and tools such as the Database, the Web Framework**, etc. Generally you don’t write much code in this layer other than glue code that communicates to the next circle inwards.

**This layer is where all the details go. The Web is a detail. The database is a detail. We keep these things on the outside where they can do little harm**.

## Finally
No, the circles are schematic. You may find that you need more than just these four. There’s no rule that says you must always have just these four. However, The Dependency Rule always applies. Source code dependencies always point inwards. As you move inwards the level of abstraction increases. The outermost circle is low level concrete detail. As you move inwards the software grows more abstract, and encapsulates higher level policies. The inner most circle is the most general [^1].

# Clean Architecture in web application [^3]
Applications that follow the Dependency Inversion Principle as well as the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles tend to arrive at a similar architecture. This architecture has gone by many names over the years. One of the first names was Hexagonal Architecture, followed by Ports-and-Adapters. More recently, it's been cited as the Onion Architecture or Clean Architecture. The latter name, Clean Architecture, is used as the name for this architecture in this e-book.

The eShopOnWeb reference application uses the Clean Architecture approach in organizing its code into projects. You can find a solution template you can use as a starting point for your own ASP.NET Core solutions in the ardalis/cleanarchitecture[^4] GitHub repository or by installing the template from NuGet[^5].

Clean architecture puts the business logic and application model at the center of the application. Instead of having business logic depend on data access or other infrastructure concerns, this dependency is inverted: infrastructure and implementation details depend on the Application Core. This functionality is achieved by defining abstractions, or interfaces, in the Application Core, which are then implemented by types defined in the Infrastructure layer. A common way of visualizing this architecture is to use a series of concentric circles, similar to an onion. Figure botoom shows an example of this style of architectural representation.

In this diagram, dependencies flow toward the innermost circle. The Application Core takes its name from its position at the core of this diagram. And you can see on the diagram that the Application Core has no dependencies on other application layers. The application's entities and interfaces are at the very center. Just outside, but still in the Application Core, are domain services, which typically implement interfaces defined in the inner circle. Outside of the Application Core, both the UI and the Infrastructure layers depend on the Application Core, but not on one another (necessarily).

Figure bottom shows a more traditional horizontal layer diagram that better reflects the dependency between the UI and other layers.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/media/image5-8.png)

Note that the solid arrows represent compile-time dependencies, while the dashed arrow represents a runtime-only dependency. With the clean architecture, the UI layer works with interfaces defined in the Application Core at compile time, and ideally shouldn't know about the implementation types defined in the Infrastructure layer. At run time, however, these implementation types are required for the app to execute, so they need to be present and wired up to the Application Core interfaces via dependency injection.

Figure bottom shows a more detailed view of an ASP.NET Core application's architecture when built following these recommendations.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/media/image5-9.png)

Because the Application Core doesn't depend on Infrastructure, it's very easy to write automated unit tests for this layer. Bottom igures show how tests fit into this architecture.

Since the UI layer doesn't have any direct dependency on types defined in the Infrastructure project, it's likewise very easy to swap out implementations, either to facilitate testing or in response to changing application requirements. ASP.NET Core's built-in use of and support for dependency injection makes this architecture the most appropriate way to structure non-trivial monolithic applications.

For monolithic applications, the Application Core, Infrastructure, and UI projects are all run as a single application. The runtime application architecture might look something like bottom figure.

Organizing code in Clean Architecture
In a Clean Architecture solution, each project has clear responsibilities. As such, certain types belong in each project and you'll frequently find folders corresponding to these types in the appropriate project.

Application Core
The Application Core holds the business model, which includes entities, services, and interfaces. These interfaces include abstractions for operations that will be performed using Infrastructure, such as data access, file system access, network calls, etc. Sometimes services or interfaces defined at this layer will need to work with non-entity types that have no dependencies on UI or Infrastructure. These can be defined as simple Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).

Application Core types
Entities (business model classes that are persisted)
Aggregates (groups of entities)
Interfaces
Domain Services
Specifications
Custom Exceptions and Guard Clauses
Domain Events and Handlers

Infrastructure
The Infrastructure project typically includes data access implementations. In a typical ASP.NET Core web application, these implementations include the Entity Framework (EF) DbContext, any EF Core Migration objects that have been defined, and data access implementation classes. The most common way to abstract data access implementation code is through the use of the Repository design pattern.

In addition to data access implementations, the Infrastructure project should contain implementations of services that must interact with infrastructure concerns. These services should implement interfaces defined in the Application Core, and so Infrastructure should have a reference to the Application Core project.

Infrastructure types
EF Core types (DbContext, Migration)
Data access implementation types (Repositories)
Infrastructure-specific services (for example, FileLogger or SmtpNotifier)
UI Layer
The user interface layer in an ASP.NET Core MVC application is the entry point for the application. This project should reference the Application Core project, and its types should interact with infrastructure strictly through interfaces defined in Application Core. No direct instantiation of or static calls to the Infrastructure layer types should be allowed in the UI layer.

UI Layer types
Controllers
Custom Filters
Custom Middleware
Views
ViewModels
Startup
